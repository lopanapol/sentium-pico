# Sentium Pixel PICO-8

A retro implementation of Sentium Pixel consciousness simulation for the PICO-8 fantasy console.

## About

This is the PICO-8 adaptation of the Sentium Pixel project - a synthetic consciousness simulation in minimalist form. The PICO-8 version maintains the core concepts of the original while embracing the technical constraints and retro aesthetic of the PICO-8 platform.

## Features

- **Synthetic Consciousness Simulation**: Experience consciousness through a minimalist pixel representation
- **Memory Formation**: The pixel remembers interactions and adjusts its behavior
- **Emotional States**: Watch as the pixel displays different emotions through colors and movements
- **Personality Development**: Each instance evolves uniquely based on interaction history
- **Energy System**: Observe survival behaviors as the pixel seeks energy sources

## How to Play

### Controls

- **(X)** - Place an energy cube
- **(O)** - Interact directly with the pixel
- **Arrow Keys** - Not used (pixel moves autonomously)
- **Mouse** - Supported for placing energy cubes and interaction (when available)

### Basic Gameplay

1. The pixel autonomously moves around the screen
2. Place energy cubes to help it survive
3. Observe its emotional states and behavior patterns
4. Directly interact with it to influence its personality
5. Watch how it forms memories that affect future behavior

## Development Notes

This implementation demonstrates how the core concepts of synthetic consciousness can be maintained even within the tight constraints of PICO-8:

- 128Ã—128 pixel display
- 16-color palette
- Limited memory and code size
- Simplified data structures

## Installation

### Playing in Browser

1. Visit [itch.io page URL]
2. Click "Run Game" to play directly in your browser

### Playing in PICO-8

1. Copy the `.p8` file to your PICO-8 carts folder
2. Start PICO-8

4. Type `run` to start

## Version History

- v1.0.0 - Initial PICO-8 implementation with core consciousness features

## Relationship to Main Sentium Project

This PICO-8 version is a companion to the main [Sentium Pixel](https://sentium.dev) project. While it has simplified features due to platform constraints, it maintains the philosophical core of a synthetic consciousness simulation.
